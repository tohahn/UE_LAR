# Exercise 01

## Problem 0.1

a. The paper describes an approach to group similar experiences of an autonomous roboter in order to be able to handle similar experiences in the future better, either by predicting the outcome of an event, being able to generate better plans, or act appropriately. The events in question are time series of sensor data from the Pioneer 2 rover. The general method is to cluster similar time series and extract a prototype from them.

The first problem that arose was to have a similarity metric between two events. Because the events are time series, some effects make the usual methods of similarity non applicable. For instance, the roboter may climb the same hill two times, one time considerable slower. Althought it is a very similar experience a metric such as the area between the curves would deliver a great dissimilarity. Thus, DTW was used to avoid this problem. DTW tries to find a morphing of the time axis such that the area between two curves (or time series) is minimized. This was done for every pair of experience, and the resulting dataset grouped with a grouping algorithm.

The results were very promising, with a minimum compliance rate of 82%. A problem was detected with the clustering algorithm, which grouped too agressively. When measures against this problem were taken, compliance rate generally went up (at least 92%), only for vision problems the compliance rate went down. This was because the DTW algorithm deleted important information by chosing warpings that minizimed the area between the curves but at the same time removed important information.
